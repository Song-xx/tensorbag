    "Restricted Boltzman Machines\n",
    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs. They are a particular form of [Boltzman Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) subject to a **restriction**. The restriction is that there are no connections between nodes within a group of units (meaning that the network form a bipartite graph, see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RBM is made of two layers, each one having a certain number of units. The input units are called **visible units** of the RBM because their states are observed. The feature detectors correspond to non-observed **hidden units**. The hidden units are often referred to as **latent variables**, as they do not result directly from the observed data. The two layers are connected through a matrix of weights. The units inside the layer are not connected, meaning that the network form a [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When RBMs are viewed as neural networks they are used as function approximators that can map the observations to the expectations of the latent variables in the top layer. The top layer can be interpreted as the learned features which can serve as inputs for a supervised learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main application of RBMs is as **generative models**.  Learning an RBM corresponds to fitting its parameters such that the RBM approximates the distribution underlying the training data. After learning, the RBM can be used to generate new samples. For instance, we can fix some visible units corresponding to a partial observation and sample the remaining visible units to complete the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question arise: is it possible to use RBMs for **classification**? There are some tricks that allows a RBM to be used in this way. One of the most interesting is to extend the input variable using an **indicator variable** as follows:\n",

    "<img src=\"../etc/img/rbm_labeled_data.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The input image of a digit is extended using a graphical $5 \\times 2$ matrix, where the location related to the number is marked in black. In this way we can train the RBM on the marked training set, and then test the classification capability on the unmarked test set. If the RBM correctly modelled the data distribution it will be able to return the marked version of the test image. Unfortunately this trick cannot be used so easily, because it implies to find a way to include the indicator variable in the training set and to easily read its value in the returned sample.\n",

    "Joint probability distribution over units\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the energy it is possible to define a series of probability distribution of both visible and hidden units. Here we consider both $v$ and $h$ as Bernoulli random variables, meaning that they are binary units (howevever there are ways to generalize to real units).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [joint probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution) of every possible pair of a visible and a hidden vector can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(v,h) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-E(v,h)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the **partition function** $Z$ is a normalisation factor, given by summing over all possible pairs of visible and hidden vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\sum_{v,h} e^{-E(v,h)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem arises when the estimation of $Z$ is required. Since both $v$ and $h$ are binary there is an exponential number of values that they can take. It is possible to understand this point considering $v$ and $h$ as bit arrays. If the array has $8$ elements then there are $2^8$ possible combination to consider. It is intuitive to understand that increasing the number of bits makes the number of possible combination explode (since there is an exponential factor involved). This problem makes the estimation of the partition function **intractable**. The intractability of $Z$ can be managed using different forms of approximation (introduced later)."

    "Since both $P(v)$ and $P(h)$ require the partition function, we cannot directly estimate them.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $H$ is the total number of hidden units and $W_{[j,:]}$ means we are accessing the $j$-th row of $W$. Here I used $\\text{exp}()$ insted of $e$ only to make the notation less cluttered. You must notice that the expression $\\text{log}(1+\\text{exp}())$ is also known as the [softplus function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) that is a smooth version of the ReLu activation function. We can rewrite $p(x)$ based on this observation:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now it is useful to analyse the last equation and try to understand when the **probability** $P(x)$ **get larger**. A first possible way to increase the probability is to increse the outcome of the product $a^{T} v$. Let's recall that $a$ is a vector of bias terms, and $v$ is a vector of binary units. Another way to increase the probability is to increase the term inside the softmax function. One way to do it is to increase the bias vector $b$. Another way is to make the visible vector $v$ well alligned with the rows of $W$.\n",
