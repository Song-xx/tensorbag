This repository contains tensorflow tutorial on different Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms. The tutorials are organised as jupyter notebooks.

1. **MNIST**: it is a famous dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used in Deep Learning. The tutorial shows how to download and prepare it for training. [[notebook]](./mnist/mnist.ipynb)

2. **CIFAR-10**: it is a dataset of 50k 32x32 color training images, labeled over 10 categories, and 10k test images. The tutorial shows where to download and how to prepare the CIFAR-10 dataset. [[notebook]](./cifar10/cifar10.ipynb)

3. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: implementation of standard GAN as in the original paper of Goodfellow et al. [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). The training and test is based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. [[notebook]](./generative_adversarial_networks/generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb)
